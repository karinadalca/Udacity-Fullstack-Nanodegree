        <p>I've always been drawn to problem solving, math and abstract thinking. My father is a computer science professor, so those things have been a big part of my life from a young age.</p>
        <p>I learned Java in high school and moved on to C++ in university where I studied computer science.  One of my first programs was to determine the possible offspring using Mendeleev’s Laws of Heredity. It’s that ability to cross domains and connect pieces that first drew me to programming. I then dove into web development, learning Javascript, React, and SQL. 
            </p>
        <p>Recently, I built a digital library of public domain books. I had to use multiple API calls, using a complex chain of promises to try and funnel the returned information from one call to another to create the array of book objects I needed to send back to the front end. It really makes you appreciate the simplicity of synchronous functions!
            </p>
        <p>My latest full-stack project was a technology funding website that allows people to choose various tech startups to fund. I worked across the stack using Stripe.js to add the money transfer feature, from funding a project to ensuring the funds were updated on the backend and the changes were reflected on the frontend.
            </p>
        <p>I enjoy being challenged and working independently and in a team to deliver a tangible product. I work well under pressure and am always interested in learning something new, improving my skills and doing learning on my own. I am looking for an environment that will allow me to build my web development capabilities and am excited to hit the ground running.
